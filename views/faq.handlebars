<h2>How To Play</h2>
<div class="address">
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  This is a racing game. Except the goal of the game is not to be the fastest but to be the slowest.<br>
  You play a monkey. To move 1 space you must pay 1 ban for each space you already moved.<br>

  <h3>Pay to Move</h3>
  To move to the first space you pay 1 ban.<br>
  To move to the second space from the first space you pay 2 ban.<br>
  And so on.<br>

  <h3>Additional Charges</h3>
  There are two situations that will cause your move to cost additional bans:<br>
  <ol>
    <li>
      If you pass another monkey in the race, they steal 1 ban from you.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
      Every time you move, 1 ban goes into the pot.<br>.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Examples Of Additional Charges</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      If you pay 1 ban to start the race, the pot gets 1 ban, and you start at position 0.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
      If you pay 2 ban as the second player, the pot gets 1 ban, the first player gets 1 ban, and you start at position 0.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
      If you pay 4 ban as the third player, the pot gets 1 ban, the first player gets 1 ban, the second player gets 1 ban, and you start at position 1.<br>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Pay to End Game</h3>
  At any point you can pay to end the game, which costs just as much as doing all the remaining moves.<br>
